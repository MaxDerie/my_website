Whether it is to celebrate, close a deal, cool down or simply to come to rest, people have become adept at finding opportunities and reasons to start drinking. However, the type of beverage and general drinking culture can vary greatly from place to place. Even in Europe, major differences can be found between the wine-tasting South, beer consuming North and spirits in the East.</description>

This will allow us to gain insights in what motives that motioned the British people to vote for a break from the European Union.</description>

      <description>Modelling in mechanical engineeringHaving graduated a masterâ€™s degree in mechanical engineering with great distinction, I have acquired extensive knowledge in building and analysing mathematical models of real-life systems. In this folder, I provide links to multiples studies that I have performed through my university carreer. In stead of gathering measurement data and performing a regression analysis to extract a working model, the approach taken in these works is rather the opposite: going out from fundamental physical laws and previously established models of subsystems, a working model of the entire system is created.</description>
