      <description>Modelling in mechanical engineeringHaving completed a masterâ€™s degree in mechanical engineering, I have acquired extensive knowledge in building and analysing mathematical models of real-life systems. In this folder, I provide links to multiples studies that I have performed through my university carreer. In stead of gathering measurement data and performing a regression analysis to extract a working model, the approach taken in these works is rather the opposite: going out from fundamental physical laws and previously established models of subsystems, a working model of the entire system is created.</description>
