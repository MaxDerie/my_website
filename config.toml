Having graduated with distinction from a master's degree in mechanical engineering and robotics at KU Leuven university, I have acquired a strong passion for modelling and data. This, together with my curiosity towards the business side of tech companies, has driven me to enroll in the Master's in Analytics and Management Programme at London Business School. I now hope to put my passion into practice through a job as data analyst in strategy consulting. In my free time, you will find me playing tennis, learning about new cultures, watching a good movie or simply socialising with my friends."
