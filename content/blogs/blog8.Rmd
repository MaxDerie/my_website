# Where Do People Drink The Most Beer, Wine And Spirits?

Drinking alcoholic beverages is an important part of culture in many parts of the world. Whether it is to celebrate, close a deal, cool down or simply to come to rest, people have become adept at finding opportunities and reasons to start drinking. However, the type of beverage and general drinking culture can vary greatly from place to place. Even in Europe, major differences can be found between the wine-tasting South, beer consuming North and spirits in the East. The aim is therefore to gain some insights into the drinking habits around the world.

## Load data

First we will load and analyse the dataset. We need to call the library "fivethirtyeight"
```{r, load_alcohol_data}
library(fivethirtyeight)
data(drinks)
```

Let's take a glimpse at it.

```{r glimpse_skim_data, echo=TRUE}
glimpse(drinks)
```
It seems that for some countries the data is zero/NA. This is likely due to legal regulations in those specific countries - data is not available. We will proceed to analyse without these.

## Data Wrangling and Plotting

We will now continue to wrangle the data so as to plot it in a conventional way.
```{r top_beer_25, echo=TRUE}

#  First we will build the data frame using dplyr and then will plot using ggplot.

top_beer_25 <- drinks %>%  # save into object "top_beer_25"
  arrange(desc(beer_servings)) %>% # Sorting on descending order to get the highest values on top
  top_n(n=25, wt=beer_servings) %>% # Get the first 25 values
  select(country, beer_servings) # Show only columns country and beer_savings

# Show results 
kable(top_beer_25)
```
Now let's look at the plot

```{r plot_25_beer, echo=TRUE}

# Use ggplot to map the data variables to aesthetic attributes of geometric objects. 



ggplot(top_beer_25, aes(x=reorder(country, beer_servings), # reorder() in x-axis will provide the order established on the df
                        y=beer_servings, 
                        fill=beer_servings)) + 
  geom_col() + # Since the data set is pre-counted, we use "geom_col()" for bar plots
  theme_bw() + # Add black & white theme
  
  scale_fill_gradient(low="#ffc692", # This function manually adds a gradient to the fill variable.
                      high="#f28e1c") +  # The codes are the hex colour codes for beer
  
  labs(title = "Namibia tops the beer charts", # add labels to the df
       subtitle = "Top 25 beer consuming countries",
       caption = "Source: fivethirtyeight.com - 2014", # Source
       fill = "Beer Servings" # Change legend name
       ) +
  xlab(NULL) +
  ylab("Servings of beer in average sizes per person") + # y-axis
  coord_flip() # flip bar plot in horizontal

```

We will now do the same with wine and spirits. The following examples will follow the same workflow. The documentation here applies for those as well.

```{r wine_plot, echo=TRUE}

# Build data frame
top_wine_25 <- drinks %>% 
  arrange(desc(wine_servings)) %>% # Sorting on descending order to get the highest values on top
  top_n(n=25, wt=wine_servings) %>% # Get the first 25 values
  select(country, wine_servings) # Show only columns country and beer_savings


# Plot
ggplot(top_wine_25, aes(x=reorder(country, wine_servings), 
                        y=wine_servings, 
                        fill=wine_servings)) +
  geom_col() +
  theme_bw() +
  
  scale_fill_gradient(low="#bb9394",
                      high="#722f37") + # hex colour codes for wine
  
  labs(title = "Wine still big in Southern Europe", 
       subtitle = "Top 25 wine consuming countries",
       caption = "Source: fivethirtyeight.com - 2014",
       fill = "Wine Servings"
       ) +
  xlab(NULL) +
  ylab("Servings of Wine in average sizes per person") +
  coord_flip()

```


```{r spirit_plot, echo=TRUE}

# Build data frame
top_spirit_25 <- drinks %>% 
  arrange(desc(spirit_servings)) %>% # Sorting on descending order to get the highest values on top
  top_n(n=25, wt=spirit_servings) %>% # Get the first 25 values
  select(country, spirit_servings) # Show only columns country and beer_savings

# Plot
ggplot(top_spirit_25, aes(x=reorder(country, spirit_servings), 
                          y=spirit_servings, 
                          fill=spirit_servings)) +
  geom_col() +
  theme_bw() +
  
  scale_fill_gradient(low="#ECF0F1",
                      high="#909497") + # hex colour codes for spirit
  
  labs(title = "Rum on top!", 
       subtitle = "Top 25 spirit consuming countries",
       caption = "Source: fivethirtyeight.com - 2014",
       fill = "Spirit Servings"
       ) +
  xlab(NULL) +
  ylab("Servings of spirit in average sizes per person") +
  coord_flip()

```

**Where do they drink the most beer, wine and spirits?**

In the previous plots, we can appreciate that countries that are producers of certain alcoholic beverages are also large consumers of that specific drink: France, Portugal and Argentina with wine; Germany and Ireland with beer; Grenada and Belarus with spirit.

At the same time, we can identify a trend related to a specific drink in some continents: when it comes to wine, the top 10 is solely composed by European countries; when it comes to spirit, the top 10 composed by countries from Central America (known by their affinity with spirit drinks) and Eastern Europe. 

Beer, however, represents a more complicated case: it's a mixture of countries from different continents and economic backgrounds. Given that beer is usually cheaper than the rest of other alcoholic beverages, it is often more consumed by people in countries with lower GDP. Because of this, we believe that the results are bound to vary a lot between countries and continents. Perhaps, information on the index price per country would be helpful to analyze this hypothesis.

Let us now aggregate the data, and have a look at which country consumes the most pure alcohol overall. 


```{r total, echo=TRUE}
# Costum color palette
pal <- c(
  "Beer" = "#f28e1c",
  "Wine" = "#722f37", 
  "Spirits" = "#909497")

# Get most popular drink per country
drinks %>% 
  mutate(most_pop_drink = case_when(
    pmax(beer_servings, wine_servings, spirit_servings) == beer_servings ~ "Beer",
    pmax(beer_servings, wine_servings, spirit_servings) == wine_servings ~ "Wine",
    pmax(beer_servings, wine_servings, spirit_servings) == spirit_servings ~ "Spirits",
  )) %>% 

# Build data frame

  arrange(desc(total_litres_of_pure_alcohol)) %>% # Sorting on descending order to get the highest values on top
  top_n(n=25, wt=total_litres_of_pure_alcohol) %>% # Get the first 25 values
  select(country, total_litres_of_pure_alcohol, most_pop_drink) %>%  # Show only columns country and beer_savings

# Plot
ggplot(aes(x=reorder(country, total_litres_of_pure_alcohol), 
                          y=total_litres_of_pure_alcohol, 
                          fill=most_pop_drink)) +
  #bar plot
  geom_col() +
  theme_bw() +
  
  #costum coloring
  scale_fill_manual(values=pal, labels=c("Beer", "Spirits", "Wine"))+ #change points according to party colors, change legend labels names 
  
  #titles
  labs(title = "Belarussians consume the most.", 
       subtitle = "Top 25 alcohol consuming countries",
       caption = "Source: fivethirtyeight.com - 2014",
       fill = "Most popular drink"
       ) +
  xlab(NULL) +
  ylab("Yearly litres of pure alcohol per person") +
  
  #make the bars horizontal
  coord_flip()

```

It appears from the data that Belarus is the largest per capita consumer of alcohol. What we can further conclude from this chart is that a that largest consumers are predominantly European countries, at 23 out of the top 25 countries. The reason for this is that Europe has an ideal climate for producing different types of alcohol, which might not be possible as much in other continents, such as Africa. As a result, consuming large amounts of alcohol has long been an important aspect of the culture. The remaining two countries in the list are both located in the Caribbean, where rum is abundantly produced.  

Finally, let us look at what drink is consumed the most on average.
```{r}

#Get average consumption over all countries
drinks %>% 
  summarise(Beer = mean(beer_servings), 
            Wine = mean(wine_servings),
            Spirits = mean(spirit_servings)) %>% 
  
  #get table into tidy format
  pivot_longer(c(Beer, Wine, Spirits), names_to ="type") %>% 
  
  #bar plot
  ggplot(aes(x = type, y = value, fill = type)) +
  geom_col() + 
  
  #costum color
  scale_fill_manual(values=pal, labels=c("Beer", "Spirits", "Wine")) +
  
  #titles
  labs(title = "Beer is the most popular beverage",
       subtitles = "Average per person servings per year",
       y = "Number of servings",
       x = NULL) + 
  
  #remove legend
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

It appears that beer is the most consumed drink on average worldwide. This was to be expected, as it is typically cheaper to buy than wine, which can be viewed as a luxury product. Because of its lower alcohol percentage than wine and spirits, beer is more rapidly consumed in casual circumstances, such as for cooling down, watching a movie, or coming to rest after a long day.
